I thought that this would be more interesting of a project and would stay interesting for longer, as instead of having a set order and number of astronomical objects, one could add, remove, and rearrange things as they pleased. I decided that the best way to allow for freedom of creativity would be to not have the astronomical object\'s bases be attached. This is so that the bases, and therefore the astronomical objects, can be moved as far or close as a person wants, as well as placed at any angle.";

The number of objects and their diameters ended up being: two 10cm, two 8cm, six 6cm, six 4cm, and four 3cm objects. After laser cutting out the circles, I spray painted one side of each circle so they would all be a bit more unique and not just a bunch of boring brown circles of wood. On the other side of each circle, instead of spray painting it, I used the vinyl cutter to cut out circular silver stickers to serve as a backing. I didn\'t paint the other side of the circles because this is not meant to be a three-dimensional model where the objects can rotate around. It is more of a display type thing, so only one side needs to be painted, since only one side will be visible from the front. Besides, I thought that the silver backing would make them look a bit more streamlined than if they were haphazardly painted on both sides, as those two individually painted sides would probably not line up well together, causing the objects to appear disjointed. For the spray painting, the objects were painted in a variety of colors so that there could be some diversity in how one would put a solar system together.";

What I did to make the stands that the objects would rest on was create a thin, approx. 4mm tall, rectangle. For aesthetic purposes I added a slight curve to the shorter ends of the rectangle. I also put a groove approx. 3mm deep in the center of the large rectangle to provide a place for the objects to be inserted. This was all done in Autodesk Inventor because Fusion and I do not get along. I created differently sized bases for each of the different sizes of object and then printed them off on the Makerbot printers. I had some trouble with some of the printers in that even when I made sure my to-be-printed objects were flat against the case plate, the printer was still printing rather far off of the plate, causing the plastic to not stick properly and ruining the print. I was in a bit of a hurry to get it printed, as the print would take around three hours to complete even when cutting lots of corners, so I moved around to different printers before eventually adding a raft to the print. Unfortunately, I had not done a test print without the raft on the printer that ultimately worked, so maybe the raft was actually pointless to add. Anywho, the raft didn\'t work out that well in terms of actually coming off the print, so I would like to attempt to print the stands again without the raft to see if they will work. The two pictures above show some of the objects in the stands. There are only two up because only two stands turned out well enough to get a good image, and even on these are a little visibly warped.";

The main issue is that I just wasn\'t thinking at all when designing them, because if I had been, I would have realized that I didn\'t need to make differently sized stands for the differently sized objects. Due to the objects being circular, they are perfectly capable of fitting into a slot that is not as wide as their diameter, since the diameter is not the part that is being inserted, only a small arc is going there. This means that even the circles with 10cm diameters can easily and securely fit in the stand that was originally designed for the circles with diameters of 3cm. This would have saved a lot of printing time, and considering the smallest one turned out the best in regard to how much raft came off, it would have been really nice if I had realized that I could just print a bunch of those. I don\'t think I made a complete mess of anything else, so on to the next section.<br><br>Second part: Things I wish I could have done differently<br>One idea I had been playing with was using the laser cutter to raster some additional designs onto the objects, such as craters. Sadly, I only thought of this after I had finished spray painting all of the circles, and I decided that the rastering of additional features on the objects might take away from their color designs. I also sort of wish that I could have made a backdrop for the entire thing, just of stars and the like, but ultimately, while I know how to create space scenes with spray paint, I knew I would not have the time to gather all the materials to do the whole thing. Which is a pity, as that would have been pretty cool.";
